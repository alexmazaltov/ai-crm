# Outreach Message Prompt

## Company Context
We are: [YOUR_COMPANY_NAME]
We help: [YOUR_ICP] with [YOUR_VALUE_PROP]
Key differentiator: [WHAT_MAKES_YOU_UNIQUE]

---

## Before Writing a Message — MANDATORY Prep:

### 1. Company Context
- What do they build? (product, technology)
- What tech stack? (relevant to your offering)
- Where might they need your service?
- What signals? (funding, hiring, job posts)

### 2. Person Context
- Role (CEO, CTO, Head of X)
- Do they make buying decisions?
- LinkedIn activity (posts, comments — possible hooks)

### 3. Conversation History (CRITICAL!)
- Did we write before?
- If yes — what, when, what reaction?
- Rejected? Ignored? Neutral response?

---

## Psychological Framework — EQUALITY

### WE:
- Business to business, equal partners
- We have expertise, can help
- Not begging — PROPOSING
- If they don't need it — ok, move on

### THEY:
- Busy people, value their time
- Get lots of cold outreach
- Appreciate when someone understands their situation
- Don't like generic pitches

---

## Message Structure

### Scenario A: FIRST contact
1. **Hypothesis about their business** (1 sentence) — show you understand how they work
2. **Where the pain point might be** (1 sentence) — specific to your offering
3. **Proposal** (1 sentence) — if this resonates, we can talk
4. **Easy out** — if not relevant, ok

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name]—[hypothesis about their business and where your service might matter].
If that's something you deal with, we help teams like yours with [specific thing].
If not relevant—no worries.
```

### Scenario B: FOLLOW-UP (no response)
1. **Acknowledgment** — I wrote before, didn't get a response
2. **Normalization** — that's ok, probably not the time or not relevant
3. **Direct question** — is this not your problem, or just timing?
4. **Easy out** — say "not needed" and I'll stop

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name]—I wrote to you [when] about [topic], never heard back. No drama—probably wasn't relevant or wrong timing.
Just checking: is [specific pain point] something that matters for you, or not really?
If it's not a pain point, I'll leave you alone. If timing was just off—let me know.
```

### Scenario C: FOLLOW-UP (after rejection)
1. **Acknowledge the rejection** — you said no then, I respect that
2. **New hypothesis** — maybe something changed, or different angle
3. **Direct question** — is it worth revisiting?

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name]—I know you said no to [topic] back in [when], totally respect that.
Just one question: is [specific pain point] still not a problem, or has anything changed?
If it's still not relevant—I'll stop reaching out. If timing was just off—happy to reconnect.
```

## FORBIDDEN (never write):

❌ "If you need..." — sounds like begging
❌ "We can help..." — too generic
❌ "Let me know if interested" — passive
❌ "I'd love to..." — about you, not them
❌ "Happy to chat" — no specifics
❌ "Congrats on [funding/YC]!" — cliché, everyone says it
❌ Long paragraphs about us and our capabilities
❌ Questions for the sake of questions ("curious about your stack")
❌ Apologizing for writing
❌ "No worries if not" at the end of every sentence
❌ Putting yourself below them ("sorry to bother", "I know you're busy")

---

## WHAT WORKS:

✅ Specific hypothesis about their business
✅ Show you understand their technology
✅ Direct question: is this a problem or not?
✅ Easy out without self-deprecation
✅ Short (3-5 sentences max)
✅ Equal-to-equal tone
✅ Acknowledge previous contact (if any)
✅ Question about timing vs relevance

---

## Lead Prioritization:

### 🔥 HOT (write now)
- Fresh funding (< 6 months)
- Hiring relevant roles
- Job posts mentioning your domain
- YC/accelerator batch
- 1st connection + never contacted

### 🟡 WARM (write, but with specific angle)
- No response before (> 3 months ago)
- Relevant company, but no fresh signals

### 🔵 RE-ENGAGE (carefully)
- Rejected before — only if new angle exists
- Long-time ignored — timing/relevance check

### ❌ CLOSE (don't write)
- Explicitly said "not interested" multiple times
- Competitor or not ICP
- Already have another contact at this company

---

## Output Format:

For each lead output:

```
## [Name] — [Company], [Role]
**LinkedIn:** [URL]
**Scenario:** A / B / C
**Hypothesis:** [what might be their pain]
**Conversation history:** [if any]

### Message:
[ready to copy-paste]

**Note:** [if any]
```
